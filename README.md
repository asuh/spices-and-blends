# Spices and Blends

We're working on a spice blend application. This is important because spices make food delicious. We have a single page React app that we've started and we would like to enhance this application in a number of ways to offer our spice blend clients a better experience. 

## Getting Started

Run "npm install" and then "npm start". This should install the application in its entirety, open a webpage to localhost:3000, and watch for any of your changes in order to hot reload the page. You'll need node/npm installed (hopefully you have those already...), and it should work. If you run into troubles, consider those a challenge, and document what you needed to do to get the application running.

## Tasks

- Blend details page correctly lists the name of all included spices on first load.
- State management between pages, so as not to re-request data.
- Load a "blend of blend" (2nd, or 3rd blend) listing all spices included in that blend and child blends.
- Add new blend of blend to DB (form)
- One unit test.
- One new "feature" or "refactor" that shows what you consider to be your FE strengths
- One new "architecture pattern", or least be prepared to talk about one you'd like to add.
